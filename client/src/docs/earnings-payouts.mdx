## **📊 How Creator Costs Work**

- 💎 **Costs are automatically determined based on NFT rarity.**
- 🏆 **Creators earn a percentage of every sale** on the marketplace (*excluding NFTs purchased with in-game currency*).
- ⏳ **Royalties are only earned after reaching a sales threshold.**  

### **🔄 Royalty Structure**
- **Royalties begin once the first 100 NFTs are sold for Common NFTs** (*see chart above for rarity selling thresholds*).
- Until this threshold is met, all proceeds go toward sustaining the **marketplace economy**.

> ⚠ **Note:** The **initial creation fee** does **not** include additional **listing fees** for the marketplace.
