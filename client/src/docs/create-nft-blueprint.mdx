# **Creating an NFT Blueprint**

## 📌 **Overview**
An **NFT Blueprint** is the foundation of your digital asset in **Booh Brawlers**. It determines the **appearance, attributes, rarity, and marketplace settings** for your NFT. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to create an NFT Blueprint using the **Concept Creator** tool.

> ⚠ **Note:** NFT Blueprints are <u>not</u> NFTs themselves. They serve as a template that enables community members to mint NFTs once they are listed in the marketplace.

2. **Access the Concept Creator**: Navigate to the **Creator Hub** and select the `Create` option.
3. **Fill Out the Form**: Input essential details such as **metadata, image, and attributes**.
4. **Click Submit**: Once submitted, a confirmation popup will appear detailing creator costs.
5. **Click Confirm**: Once confirmed, pay the creator cost through the wallet transaction.

## 🏪 **NFT Blueprint Form**
The **NFT Blueprint details** section includes data that determines how your NFT is displayed and sold in the marketplace.

**Note:** NFT names must be unique. If an NFT name is already taken, a new name must be selected.

---

## 🖼️ **Metadata & Image Upload**
NFT metadata includes a **description, name, and image file**.

### **Image Requirements:**
- ✅ **Format**: JPG, PNG, or SVG
- ✅ **Size**: **512x512 px** or smaller
- ✅ **Must be a square crop**
- ❌ **No offensive or inappropriate content**

2. Choose a file that meets the above criteria.
3. Ensure it matches the **NFT's theme and description**.

## 🔢 **Attributes & Rarity**
NFTs come with predefined **attributes and rarities**, which impact gameplay and pricing.

<NftRarityTable />

### **Choosing Rarity:**
- **Higher rarity NFTs cost more to create** but allow **more powerful attributes**.
- Rarity **affects the NFT's power, value, and game impact**.

---

## 💰 **Creator Costs**
Creating an NFT Blueprint requires **a creator fee**, which varies depending on the **rarity** of the NFT.

This fee is to protect the community from bots and spammers with funds generated to help game improvements.

<NftCostTable />

### **How Creator Costs Work:**
- **Costs are automatically determined based on rarity.**
- **Creators earn a percentage of every sale on the marketplace (excluding NFTs purchased with In-game currency).**
- **Creators do not earn Royalties until the selling threshold has been met**
- **Royalties are only earned after the initial sales threshold is met** (e.g., For common nfts, the first 100 NFTs must be sold before royalties begin to generate).

> 📖 See [Earnings & Payouts](./docs?page=create) for full details.

## 🎯 **Talent Point Allocation**
Each NFT has **talent points** that define its power and abilities. Talent points must be **carefully distributed**, as they impact gameplay balance.

### **Allocation Rules:**
✅ **Each rarity has a max talent point cap.**  
✅ **Some attributes have predefined limits.**  
✅ **Admins may override restrictions if necessary.**  

> ⚠ **Note:** If you exceed the allowed talent points, you will receive a warning and must adjust your values.

---

## 🔒 **Approval & Metadata Locked**
Once an NFT Blueprint is submitted and approved, **most fields become locked** to prevent unauthorized modifications.

### **Locked Fields:**
- **Name**
- **Image**
- **Talent Allocation**
- **Rarity**

An NFT Blueprint **must pass review and marketplace approval** before appearing in the Marketplace.

---

## ✅ **Final Steps & Submission**
1. **Review All Details**: Ensure all information is correct before submission.
2. **Click 'Create NFT Concept'**: This will **generate** the blueprint.
3. **Wait for Admin Approval**: Once approved, the NFT will be **available for purchase**.

🎉 **Congratulations! Your NFT Blueprint is now part of Booh Brawlers!**
